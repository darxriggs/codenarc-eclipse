* make path of workspace/project-specific ruleset files relative to the workspace/ruleset
** see "CodeNarc-Plugin" -> Run As -> Run Configurations... -> Eclipse Application -> Main -> Location: ${workspace_loc}/...


* project builder
  * ensures that codenarc is notified whenever there is a file change and can then incrementally update files with new codenarc markers
  * may be annoying if codenarc is very slow
* objectcontribution filter says *.groovy
  * this means that *.dsld, *.gradle, *.easyb, etc files cannot be sent to codenarc
  * perhaps push that check into the action itself and compare against the file's content type
* creating the markers on a file
  * make sure to grab a lock on that file
* scheduling rules
  * org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.JobManager.beginRule(ISchedulingRule, IProgressMonitor)
  * org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.JobManager.endRule(ISchedulingRule)
* as suggested by Andrew: let him include codenarc-eclipse in the composite update site that also includes groovy-eclipse
  * result: reach more people
